let me explain my assignment little bit.
So, first. WordPress is a really good idea to build website. If you buy WordPress premium package, you will get lots of fancy performance on website.
I assume the purpose of this assignment is to test my coding and designing skill, so I only use html, CSS and bootstrap ,those basic skill to build this website.

Second, I want to share some my suggestions on your website with you.

1.menu icon on the top right corner overlap the pause /start icon on the background image

Solution: I delete that pause/start icon in my assignment website, because by click that image it will stop sliding and stay on that image, continue sliding by clicking other place other then image.

2.After I clicked the menu bar, it pop up  purple page of those selections( HOME ,ABOUT,....). It does not look good to me, because I feel purple color is full of my screen.

Solution: I check some popular templates, I think it is good ideal to place those selection on navbar. I also top the navbar, which means navbar will stay at top, when users scroll page down. This actually gives our users navigation directly while they reading the page.

3.About us and Explore more about us. There are 2 section called About us and More about us. When I clicked READ MORE button under About us, it direct me to a new page which repeats content of ABOUT US.

Solution: Personally, I think the it is better to leave a link which can direct users to more about us or more service. So, we don't need use lots of paragraph to explain in the landing page.

4. By checking animation at right of ABOUT US. You can see there is galshir.com on the left-bottom of that animation. My understanding about building website especially company website should not display those reference where you get images, animations, or this built by other companies.

Solution: We can find some unprotected animation instead, or make gif by ourselves. If we want to reference some company or some website, we can hide reference in our code line. In my assignment I use gif editor to crop this gif without displaying website address and reference that website in my code line.

5.Explore service button doesn't work.

Solution: change href=our-service

6.icon up at right-bottom corner does not show up when you scroll down to bottom of the page. icon up is the link allow user to click to go back top of page. By inspecting its CSS, I found when user scroll down to the bottom, display change from block to none. That is the reason why icon up doesn't show up at bottom.

Solution: check icon up in my assignment

Third, in my assignment.
1. I fix the navbar at top of the page. Each selection will direct to user to each section of the page (click ABOUT will direct you to ABOUT US section). And social icon will help user contact us, find us directly. I also put search bar there for the future use, if the company has lots of page content, this will bring convenience for user to do search keywords.

2.You may notice the images display in the slides not quite clear, because I try to find some images which pixels can match the screen. But it a little bit hard to search from the website.

3.(for question b)I try to change color in the theme to Rubine Red C-#CE0058. But original website use flora theme which is a theme plugin from WordPress, I cannot change it directly, so I apply  Rubine Red C color to some characters, borders, background color and icon up to create  Rubine Red C color theme.

4.(for question c,d)I upload images which represent different cultures from different countries. Because February is Chinese new year (the year pig) so I changed icon up to be a small pig icon, and I paint icon background color to Rubine Red C color to apply the theme . I know multicultural is one of the core values of DV8, I suggest we can use different themes in different time especially some countries celebrate important festival or day. We can change the images, icon, or theme color to celebrate that day.

5. I applied  font-family "Coiny" and  "Mr Dafoe" to Typography

6.The reason I didn't show explore more about us, because I think it is landing page which give users a general idea what kinds of company we are. So I leave the about us section and a link to More Service.

7.I also add contact us page at bottom of page, once backend function built. We can catch message from our clients. and I left my contact information there.
